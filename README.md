# Financial Machine Learning

A library of learning algorithms used to predict financial outcomes based on financial data and optimise systematic trading algorithms.

The main feature of this program is the implementation of [genetic algorithms](https://github.com/ethanhollins/financialml/tree/master/Models/GeneticAlgorithm) in the pursuit of optimising existing systematic trading algorithms. This utilised a custom Numpy JIT compiled backtester, trading algorithm and genetic algorithm in order to achieve an algorithm capable of converging on an optimal set of trading system parameters.
